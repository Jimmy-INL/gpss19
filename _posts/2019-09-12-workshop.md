- title: "Constraining Gaussian processes by variational Fourier features"
  abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a powerful framework for extrapolation, interpolation, and noise removal in regression and classification. In this talk we consider constraining GPs to arbitrarily-shaped domains with boundary conditions. We solve a Fourier-like generalised harmonic feature representation of the GP prior in the domain of interest, which both constrains the GP and attains a low-rank representation that is used for speeding up inference. The method scales as O(nm^2) in prediction and O(m^3) in hyperparameter learning for regression, where n is the number of data points and m the number of features. Furthermore, we make use of the variational approach to allow the method to deal with non-Gaussian likelihoods. The experiments cover both simulated and empirical data in which the boundary conditions allow for inclusion of additional physical information.

- title: "Uncertainty in compositional models with application to temporal alignment"
  abstract: In this talk, I will present a series of work on composite models with applications to temporal alignment of sequences. Given a set of time series sequences, the temporal alignment task consists of finding monotonic warps of the inputs (which typically correspond to time) that remove the differences in the timing of the observations. There are three intrinsic sources of ambiguity in this problem that motivate the use of probabilistic modelling. Firstly, the temporal alignment problem is ill-posed: there are infinitely many ways to align a finite set of sequences and weâ€™d like to model this warping uncertainty. Secondly, the observed sequences might correspond to multiple different unknown underlying functions, hence the assignment of sequences to groups is ambiguous. Furthermore, the observed sequences are often noisy, requiring a principled way to model the observational noise. We introduce a non-parametric probabilistic model of monotonic warps and model each sequence as a composition of such a warp and a standard GP. To represent the warping uncertainty, we study the compositional uncertainty (arising from multiple different compositions of functions resulting in the same overall function) in such a two-layer model. To allow for alignment in multiple groups and to find these groups in an unsupervised manner, we use probabilistic alignment objectives (such as GP-LVM or DPMM). Finally, we discuss the requirements on the inference scheme that allows us to propagate the uncertainty through the model.
